# MRnaProcessor

 Generates gene sequences from an input containing the letters of the genetic code. The input string is typically generated by automatic sequencing of mRNA. In the industry there is a standard to include metadata and comments to these files by adding lines prefixed with “>” (greater then) character. All data after that character until the end of the line can be ignored. The remaining data in the input string may contain whitespace characters (space, tab, linefeed, Unicodewhitespace) which have no semantic meaning and should be ignored. Apart from whitespace the string should only contain the four characters  A, U, G, C which may appear in upper or lowercase representation. The function should process the string from the first position. The string contains none, one or more “genes” (sequences of codons terminated by a stop codon) and possible “noise”, a sequence of stop codons. The function should return the genes, each consisting of a sequence of codons and terminated by a single “stop codon”. More stop codons should be treated as noise and be discarded.

## Elixir: the programming language of choice
The obvious question is why Elixir? Why not use Java or Javascript, two of the languages I'm more experienced in?
Well, for starters I've been studying one of the rising stars of functional languages and I found that it's very fast (built on top of Erlang VM, if you've never heard of it, it powers WhatsApp's & Discord's high availability & performance), more concise (syntax inspired by Ruby) while amazingly feature-rich, flexible and expressive (Clojure, Python, Lisp also served as inspiration among others). Now, I'm relatively new to Elixir (I picked it up in autumn 2020), but the more I'm learning the more impressed I am and the more I love the language. Immutability is the most obvious benefit. But there are many features that make Elixir great: pattern matching, the pipe operator(https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/enumerables-and-streams.html#the-pipe-operator), lazy operations with Streams (https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/enumerables-and-streams.html#streams), sigils (https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/sigils.html), metaprogramming, to name just a few. Yes, as you might have already noticed that I would definitely describe my encounter and my journey with Elixir in terms of passion and affection, just like these senior programmers do here: https://exercism.io/tracks/elixir/mentors).

To end this section, I'll just copy the introductory paragraphs from Elixir's official web page, next https://elixir-lang.org/: 
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.
Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. Elixir is successfully used in web development, embedded software, data ingestion, and multimedia processing, across a wide range of industries.

## Install Elixir

See https://elixir-lang.org/install.html
The easiest way is to use a package manager. On Windows, with Chocolatey, just Run: cinst elixir

### Installing Erlang
The only prerequisite for Elixir is Erlang, version 21.0 or later. When installing Elixir, Erlang is generally installed automatically for you. If that's not the case, consult the documentation on how to install Erlang manually.

### Setting PATH environment variable
It is highly recommended to add Elixir’s bin path to your PATH environment variable to ease development.

### Checking the installed version of Elixir
Once you have Elixir installed, you can check its version by running elixir --version.

## Implementation details

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ mix test
```

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `m_rna_processor` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rna_processor, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/rna_processor](https://hexdocs.pm/rna_processor).
